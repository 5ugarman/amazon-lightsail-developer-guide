# Making contributions to the Amazon Lightsail documentation on GitHub<a name="amazon-lightsail-making-contributions-to-documentation-on-github"></a>

 *Last updated: May 16, 2019* 

The Amazon Lightsail documentation is on GitHub in the [Lightsail developer guide repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-lightsail-developer-guide)\. In the repository, you can complete the following actions:
+ Fix typos and documentation bugs, add information, and rewrite sentences and paragraphs in the interest of accuracy or clarity\.
+ Write and submit new guides if there's something missing that you would like to see documented\.
+ Look at the commit history to learn more about new feature and service launches and to track improvements to the documentation\.

In this guide, we show you how to [edit an existing guide](#editing-an-existing-guide) or how to [create a new guide](#creating-a-new-guide) by creating a pull request on GitHub\. After you submit a pull request, it will be reviewed by the Lightsail team and a decision will be made to accept it, reject it, or to engage in a conversation with you to learn more\. You will get a response to your pull request within 48 hours\. If your request is accepted, then it will be published to the Lightsail documentation in the next round of updates typically within two weeks\.
