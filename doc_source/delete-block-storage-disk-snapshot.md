# Delete disk snapshots in Lightsail<a name="delete-block-storage-disk-snapshot"></a>

 *Last updated: November 14, 2017* 

You can delete one or more snapshots of a block storage disk in Lightsail\. 

**Note**  
If you make periodic snapshots of a disk, the snapshots are incremental\. Only the blocks on the device that have changed after your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot\. Even though snapshots are saved incrementally, the snapshot deletion process is designed so that you need to retain only the most recent snapshot to restore the entire disk\.

**Delete an individual disk snapshot**

1. From the Lightsail home page, choose **Snapshots**\.

1. Find the disk that has the snapshot you want to delete, and then expand the list of snapshots by choosing the disk name\.
